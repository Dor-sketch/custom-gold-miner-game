# Custom Gold Miner Game

- This is a custom gold miner game that I created using Python and Pygame. The game is a simple 2D game where the player controls a miner who use a hook to collect gold and other treasures.
- The player can throw the hook to collect the treasures and earn points.
- The main feutures of the game is the webassembly support, which allows the game to be played in the browser.
